# Final Project: GAN for Cybersecurity  
This repository contains a project that uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic cybersecurity‑data and then validates the synthetic data with a simple neural network.

## 🧠 Overview
- The purpose of this project is to explore applying a GAN model in the context of cybersecurity data: to **generate synthetic data** that mimics certain properties of real data, and then to **validate** how usable these synthetic samples are.  
- The workflow is:
  1. Use the notebook `GAN_code.ipynb` to train a GAN and produce synthetic samples (stored in `synthetic_saves/`).  
  2. Use the notebook `Simple_NN.ipynb` to train/test a simple neural‑network model that ingests both real and synthetic samples, to assess how well the synthetic data can be used for downstream tasks or how realistic/useful it is.

## ✅ Key Notebooks
- **GAN_code.ipynb** — This is the *main code* for the project. It handles:  
  - loading/preprocessing the real cybersecurity dataset,  
  - defining the GAN architecture (generator + discriminator),  
  - training the GAN,  
  - saving the trained generator (`generator_model.h5`) and generating synthetic samples which are stored in `synthetic_saves/`.  
- **Simple_NN.ipynb** — This notebook serves as a *validation neural network*. It loads both the real dataset and the synthetic samples generated by the GAN (from `synthetic_saves/`), then trains/tests a simple NN model to evaluate how well synthetic data performs (e.g., classification, anomaly detection, or whatever downstream task you have defined).  

## 🛠 How to Use
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Phasio3/Final-Project-GAN-Cybersecurity.git
   cd Final-Project-GAN-Cybersecurity
   ```  
2. Ensure you have the required Python environment (e.g., `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit‑learn`, etc.).  
3. Run **GAN_code.ipynb**:  
   - Load the real dataset from the “Training and Testing Sets” folder.  
   - Train the GAN.  
   - Generate synthetic samples and store them in `synthetic_saves/`.  
4. Then run **Simple_NN.ipynb**:  
   - Load the synthetic samples and optionally the original real samples.  
   - Train/test the neural network to validate how well the synthetic data works for your application.  
5. Inspect results, metrics (accuracy, loss, similarity, etc.), and saved models.

## 📋 What’s in `synthetic_saves/`
The `synthetic_saves/` folder contains the synthetic data output from the GAN. These samples are then used by the validation notebook (`Simple_NN.ipynb`) to test how well they integrate with real‑data workflows.

## 🔍 Why This Matters
- Generating realistic synthetic cybersecurity data can help with scenarios where real labelled data is scarce, imbalanced, or sensitive.  
- Validating synthetic data ensures the generated samples are not just superficially plausible but **useful** for downstream tasks (e.g., classification, detection) and not misleading.  
- The two‑step workflow (generation → validation) provides a pipeline for experimenting with data augmentation, anomaly simulation, and other applications in cyber‑security research.

## 🤝 Contributing & Next Steps
- Improvements could include: more advanced GAN architectures, improved data preprocessing, more rigorous validation networks, or applying this pipeline to other cybersecurity datasets.  
- If you’d like to contribute: add feature‐branches, raise issues for new ideas/features, submit pull‑requests.  
- Please document changes and update this README accordingly.
